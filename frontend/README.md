This is my own solution to CodeGeeks test task.

To run application follow next steps:

1. download repository (clone or download zip file)
2. install dependencies on frontend and backend by open terminal in each of folders and running npm install.
3. run server with command npm run dev:server
4. run react app with command npm run dev

Now you are ready to go :)
